# Overview of Project

Setting up a mini version of the AI agent to be used as a fully functioning demo, on 3 different client profiles with different tool permissions.


Features:
- Chatbot that asks you clarifying questions until it can confidently say it understands what the request is / what needs to be done
- Acces to tools: Mail, Settings, Slack
- The agent will have access to prior Convos and get context from it
